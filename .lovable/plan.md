# 💌 "Will You Be My Valentine?" Website

A cute, pixel-art styled Valentine's website with 3 interactive screens and playful animations.

---

## Screen 1 — The Envelope
- Soft pinkish background covered with scattered small red hearts
- A pixel-art style envelope centered on the page with a heart seal
- Text below: **"♡ Letter For You ♡"** in a pixel/retro font
- The envelope is clickable — clicking it transitions to Screen 2

## Screen 2 — The Question
- A retro-styled "window" dialog box with a pink checkered background
- Title bar says **"LOVE"** with pixel hearts decoration
- Text: **"Will you be my Valentine?"**
- A cute pixel-art black cat holding a heart, with a gentle **bobbing animation** (floating up and down)
- Two buttons: **YES** and **NO**
  - **YES** button works normally and takes you to Screen 3
  - **NO** button is **uncatchable** — it teleports to a random position on hover, making it impossible to click 😄
- Same scattered hearts background behind the window

## Screen 3 — The Celebration
- Same retro window style
- Text: **"Yippeeee!"** with floating hearts
- The cat now does a happy **dancing/wiggling animation**
- A **video player** embedded below, playing a video from a Google Drive link (placeholder link for now — you can swap it in later)
- Confetti or extra floating hearts for celebration vibes
